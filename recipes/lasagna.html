            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the
                    lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and
                    set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add
                    the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
                    Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the ground beef to the skillet, season with salt and
                    pepper, and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon
                    as it cooks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the crushed tomatoes, reduce heat, and let simmer
                    for 15–20 minutes to develop the flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with half of the
                    Parmesan cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a baking
                    dish. Layer noodles over the sauce, followed by ricotta
                    mixture, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
                    until all ingredients are used, ending with sauce and
                    mozzarella on top.
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
                <li>
                    Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and
                    bake for another 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly
                    and golden.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing.
                    Garnish with fresh basil if desired and serve.
